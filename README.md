This project focuses on predicting forest fires using regression techniques. It serves as a practical exercise to implement a RESTful API for a Flask application. The application is designed to be deployed on Render via a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, enabling automatic deployment. This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning models with web services and continuous deployment practices.
